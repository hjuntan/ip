# **Toothless User Guide**

Toothless is a desktop app for managing tasks, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). It is a chatbot that helps you keep track of your tasks. 
It is ~~a simple~~ an easy-to-use task manager that is optimized for use via a CLI while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 

If you can type fast, Toothless can get your tasks managed faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
2. Download the latest `toothless.jar` from [here]() to your computer.
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Toothless.
4. Open a command terminal and `cd` to the home folder. Then run `java -jar toothless.jar` to start the app.

## Features

### Notes about the command format

> [!TIP]
> - Words in `<angle_brackets>` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
    e.g. in `todo <task description>`, `<task description>` is a parameter which can be used as `todo read book`.
> - Commands with multiple parameters must be specified in the correct order.
  e.g. `event <task description> /from <date> /to <date>` must be specified in that exact order.
> - Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list` and `bye`) will be ignored.
  e.g. if the command specifies `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.
> - Commands are case-insensitive.
  e.g. `todo` and `ToDo` are equivalent.
> - Commands must be mentioned in full.
  e.g. `t` is not a valid command.
> - Commands that are not recognized will be ignored.
  e.g. `blah` is not a valid command.
> - Commands with invalid parameters will be ignored.
  e.g. `todo` without a description will be ignored.
> - Commands use the 24-hour clock format for time.
  e.g. `22:00` is 10pm.
> - Commands do not support the use of the `|` character.
